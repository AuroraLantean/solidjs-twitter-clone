## Usage

SolidJs Ts Template: https://github.com/solidjs/templates
TailwindCss + Solid: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/solidjs
Solid Icon: https://solid-icons.vercel.app/

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ pnpm install
```
